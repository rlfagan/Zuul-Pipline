# Zuul-Pipline

 Zuul job to perform a FOSSA analysis:
  
 Example job definition:

yaml

- job:
    name: fossa-analyze
    description: Analyze the project with FOSSA for license compliance
    run: playbooks/fossa-analyze.yaml
    secrets:
      - fossa_api_key

- secret:
    name: fossa_api_key
    data:
      fossa_api_key: !encrypted/pkcs1-oaep
        - <your encrypted FOSSA API key here>

    Create an Ansible Playbook for the Job: Next, create the Ansible playbook referenced in the job configuration. This playbook (playbooks/fossa-analyze.yaml in the example) will contain the steps to install FOSSA CLI and run the analysis.

Example playbook:

yaml

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install FOSSA CLI
      shell: |
        curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fossas/fossa-cli/master/install-latest.sh | bash
      args:
        executable: /bin/bash

    - name: Run FOSSA Analyze
      shell: |
        FOSSA_API_KEY={{ fossa_api_key }} fossa analyze
      args:
        executable: /bin/bash
      environment:
        FOSSA_API_KEY: "{{ lookup('env', 'FOSSA_API_KEY') }}"

In this playbook:

    The first task uses the shell module to execute the FOSSA CLI installation script.
    The second task runs fossa analyze, setting the FOSSA_API_KEY environment variable from a secret defined in the Zuul configuration.

Make sure to replace <your encrypted FOSSA API key here> with your actual FOSSA API key, encrypted using Zuul's encryption mechanism for secrets.

    Commit and Push Your Changes: After setting up the job and playbook, commit these changes to your repository. Zuul, if configured properly for your project, will pick up the changes and run the defined job as part of its pipeline execution.

This setup assumes you have basic familiarity with Zuul and Ansible. Adjustments might be needed based on the specific requirements of your project and the configuration of your Zuul instance.
